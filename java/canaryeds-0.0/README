**************

The following directory structure exists for the CANARYEDS repository

Files:
pom.xml		     - Contains the parent POM for CANARYEDS modules
pom-modules.xml      - Contains a POM to build different modules for unified Javadocs

Directories/Modules:
canary-core-old/     - Contains the v4 CanarysCore.jar source code
canareds-base/       - Contains the base CANARYEDS _library_ functionality
canaryeds-program/   - Contains the GUI and command line executable files module
canaryeds-external*/ - Contains specific drivers for different middleware (future work)
canaryeds-builder/   - Contains a configuration file builder program
canaryeds-pom/       - Contains only the parent POM, for continuous integration builder
examples/            - Contains example configuration and data files for CANARYEDS 5

Externals:
seme-framework-1.0/  - Contains the Seme Framework 1.0 release source code

To build CANARYEDS:

1. Build the Seme Framework, or install the Jar for seme-framework-1.0.jar into your local maven repo
   > cd seme-framework-1.0
   > mvn clean compile install

2. Install the org.canaryeds::gov-sandia-canaryeds parent POM in your local maven repo
   > cd canaryeds-pom
   > mvn install

3. Build the canaryeds-base module to get the library functions
   > cd canaryeds-base
   > mvn clean compile install

Doing the three above will give access to the following packages:
 - gov.sandia.seme.framework
 - gov.sandia.seme.util
 - org.canaryeds.base
 - org.canaryeds.base.*

The canaryeds-program module has the following dependencies:
 - seme-framework-1.0
 - canaryeds-base
 - canary-core-old
 - canaryeds-external-eddies (empty jar at this time)

The canaryeds-program/src/main/java/gov/sandia/canaryeds/program/CanaryEDS.java file contains the commandline routine which shows how to use CANARYEDS as a library, assuming that the routine calling CANARY does not exit from main :-)

The seme-framework-1.0 tests _should_ all be passing!
