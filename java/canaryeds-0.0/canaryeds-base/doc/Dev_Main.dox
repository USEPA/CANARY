The %CANARY-EDS (Continuous Analysis of Networked Array of Sensors 
for Event Detection) software was written to perform event detection
on drinking water quality data. It is based on statistical and signal
processing algorithms which analyze data collected from water quality
sensors, such as chlorine level, pH, conductivity, etc. These data
come from a network of sensors placed at remote locations.

Though targeted for the water industry, the generic approaches taken
can be used for any time-series quality data. The reason that the 
core %CANARY algorithms are generic is due to some of the quirks of 
the water industry -- there are lots of water quality sensors on the
market, and a single utility may use many different types of sensors
from different manufacturers based on location, budget, and age. 
%CANARY's algorithms are designed to work even if there is no prior
knowledge as to what type of sensors are available.

The downside to having generic algorithms is that they are not as good
as highly specific algorithms that can make use of extra domain 
knowledge. To this end, CANARY-EDS version 4 began making extensions
available where other parties could write their own algorithms and
plug them in to %CANARY. The version 5 update to %CANARY-EDS expands
this plug-in framework to allow writing custom input and output 
drivers as well as custom algorithms, and it also transitions %CANARY
to a fully Java-based toolkit. By moving to pure Java, %CANARY-EDS
can now be called within other software as a library, making use
of the event detection services without having to launch a separate,
heavy process the way version 4 required.

The Developers Manual focuses on documentation of %CANARY design
principles and class structures; it derives principally from annotated
source code.
